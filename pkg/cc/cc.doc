cc:
  This package supports compiling C code.  It includes the C dependency
  scanner and pretty printer, as well.
BUGS:
  Comments and #if are not supported by the include file scanner.
  Spaces are not supported in include search paths. Technically,
  this is the script's fault, since odin gives one entry per line,
  with no added characters.
  Similarly, spaces are not supported in the +define option.
  The ld option +eprof is unused.  I suspect it was supposed to be
  independent of +prof, and just for the linker.
:c->:c.one.list
  Convert a C file name into a list of filenames
:c.sm->:c.sm.list
  Convert a list of C files in a file into a normal list
:FILE->:c_inc.view_desc
  Convert a file to a list of possible include files.  This is for
  anything that preprocess with cpp.  Note that it does not support
  filtering by definitions or commented-out lines.  The output format
  is compatible with the built-in :view transformation; all groups are
  terminated by the empy string, so if an include file cannot be
  found, it is ignored.

  Any filenames which match the egrep pattern in the +ignore parameter(s)
  or the \$ODIN_IGNORE variable are filtered out.  Generally, ODIN_IGNORE
  should include the system directories, like /usr/include.

  The +inc_sp parameter specifies search paths; multiple options add
  more paths in the order given.  Spaces are not supported in search
  paths.  The \$ODIN_CC_I variable is intended to be cpp's built-in
  search path, which is appended to the search list.  +home is
  simply an alternate, single-entry option to prepend to the path.
  For local includes (using "" instead of $<>$), the file's source
  directory is prepended to the path as well.
:c_inc.view_desc->:c_inc
  This processes the :c_inc.view_desc entries, filtering them for
  existence and making them into a list.
:c_inc->:all_c_inc
  This recursively scans all entries of the list, producing more
  :c_inc and appending them to the list.
:c->:o
  This compiles C code into object code.  Its options are passed to
  the C compiler as follows:
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item +gnu, +cc, and \$ODIN_CC may specify the compiler, in that
        order.  +gnu is merely a shortcut for +cc=gcc.  The compiler
        is parsed into command-line elements like a shell command.  The
	search path is +cc_home, \$ODIN_CC_HOME, and the path from the last
	cache reset, in that order.  The default value of ODIN_CC is set
        in the config package when Odin is first configured.
  \item Specifying +debug adds the debugger option specified by
        \$ODIN_CC_DEBUGF, which defaults to -g.
  \item Specifying +prof adds the profiling option -pg.
  \item Specifying +optimize=$<$type$>$ adds the optimization option
        -O$<$type$>$.
  \item For each +define parameter, a -D$<$parm$>$ option is added.  Note
        that spaces are not supported: they separated multiple
        parameters.  This is not a problem when only defining the
        symbol, but may require work for defining its value.
  \item For each +inc_sp parameter, a -I$<$parm$>$ option is added.  Once
        again, spaces are not supported.
  \item Finally, the parameter +cc_flags and the variable
        \$ODIN_CC_FLAGS specify any other options, in that order.
        These are parsed in a shell-like manner.  Any flags whic could
        be specified using the more specific options should be used
	instead for compatibility.
  \item Actually, there is one more set of parameters:  -c to specify
        only an object file, and -o $<$output$>$ to create the appropriate
	output file.
  \end{itemize}
  
  When the compiler is run, all standard output is printed directly to
  the user.  Any standard error messages are collected as warnings or
  errors.  Which of the two they are is determined by the compiler's
  return code:  success produces warnings, and failure produces errors.
:library_flags->:exe
  This runs the linker on C code.  Note that the linker in this case
  is the C compiler without the -c option.  Its options are passed to
  the C compiler as follows:
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item +gnu, +cc, and \$ODIN_CC may specify the compiler, as with :c
        to :o.  In addition, purify may be run by selecting +purify;
        the multiple +purify options are concatenated and prepended to
        the linker command.  When done, any extra result files from
        purity are removed.  As with individual C compilation, the
	search path is determined by the +cc_home parameter, the
	\$ODIN_CC_HOME variable, and the path from the last cache reset,
	in that order.
  \item Specifying +debug and +prof work the same way as with :c to
        :o.  The +eprof flag is unused.
  \item Then, any generic opions are added from +ld_flags and
        ODIN_CC_FLAGS, respectively.  Spaces are interpreted as
	separators regardless for these two as well.
  \item Finally, any +libs parameters are turned into appropriate -l
        parameters and tacked on, in the order they were found.
  \end{itemize}
:c->:fmt
  This runs the C code through indent, with no special options.
:c->:c.h
  This is an obsolete transformation that will be removed soon.  It
  attempts to produce prototypes, but it does not use the C definitions
  and include path, and its pattern for finding functions only extracts
  functions with just a type name followed by a function name on a
  separate line with no space between the name and the opening
  parentheses.
