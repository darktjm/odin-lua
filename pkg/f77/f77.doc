BUGS:
  There is no ./configure fortran compiler detection or associated env
  overrides like for C/C++
  Not sure why there's a debug env var for C/C++, but there isn't for f77
  No +gnu option to select gfortran/g77 like with C/C++
  No easy way to use f2c instead
f77:
  This package enables compilation of Fortran programs.
:f->:o
  Compile Fortran code.  Its options are passed to the Fortran
  compiler as follows:
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item +f77 may specify the compiler; the default is f77.  The compiler
        is parsed into command-line elements like a shell command.  The
	search path is +f77_home, followed by the path from the last
	cache reset.
  \item +prof adds the profiling option -pg.
  \item +debug adds the debugging option -g.
  \item +f77_flags may be used to add arbitrary command line options
  \item The only other options are -c and the source file name.
  
  When the compiler is run, all standard output is printed directly to
  the user.  Any standard error messages are collected as warnings or
  errors.  Which of the two they are is determined by the compiler's
  return code:  success produces warnings, and failure produces errors.
  \end{itemize}
