BUGS:
  Spaces are not supported in include search paths. Technically,
  this is the script's fault, since odin gives one entry per line,
  with no added characters.
  Similarly, spaces are not supported in the +define option.
  The ld option +eprof is unused.  I suspect it was supposed to be
  independent of +prof, and just for the linker.
cpp:
  This package supports running arbitrary files through the C
  preprocessor.
:FILE->:cpp
  Run the C preprocessor on a file, retaining its type.  The C
  preprocessor is defined by the \$ODIN_CPP environment variable.
  Options are passed as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item For each +define parameter, a -D$<$parm$>$ option is added.  Note
        that spaces are not supported: they separated multiple
        parameters.  This is not a problem when only defining the
        symbol, but may require work for defining its value.
  \item For each +inc_sp parameter, a -I$<$parm$>$ option is added.  Once
        again, spaces are not supported.
  \item The environment variable \$ODIN_CPP_FLAGS is then appended.
  \end{itemize}
:cpp_in->:gnc.cpp
  Run the C preprocessor on a file, changing its type according to its
  file name pattern after stripping the ,c extension.  The
  preprocessor is defined by the \$ODIN_CPP environment variable.
  Options are passed as follows: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item For each +define parameter, a -D$<$parm$>$ option is added.  Note
        that spaces are not supported: they separated multiple
        parameters.  This is not a problem when only defining the
        symbol, but may require work for defining its value.
  \item For each +inc_sp parameter, a -I$<$parm$>$ option is added.  Once
        again, spaces are not supported.
  \item The environment variable \$ODIN_CPP_FLAGS is then appended.
  \end{itemize}
