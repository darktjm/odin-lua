lex:
  This package supports automatically generated lexical analyzers.
BUGS:
  No direct flex support (hard-coded name of lex tool is lex)
  +yaccid is blindly overinclusive
:l->:c
  This produces a C file using \texttt{lex}.  If the +yaccid parameter is
  specified, all occurreces of yy in resulting output are turned into
  the given ID, and all occurreces of YY are turned into the ID converted
  to upper-case.  Note that this includes yy and YY within any literal
  C code or other text inserted by \texttt{lex}.
