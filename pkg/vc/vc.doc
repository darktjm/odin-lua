BUGS:
  Not even the pathetic '' attempt at quoting file names in view specs
  No way to support revision control systems that use a server or a
  single source (e.g. svn, git, NoWeb, etc.)
vc:
  This package supports files in revision control systems (only RCS
  and SCCS are supported).  The \texttt{:try.co} type in particular
  can be parented by other version control systems to hook in.
  However, it is likely that the \texttt{:vc*view.source.spec}
  derivation needs to be overridden as well.
:,v->:log
  Get the RCS information for a revision control file.  The parameters
  specify information for a particular revision.
:,v->:co
  Check out a version from RCS.  The parameters specify a version
  other than the top.
:sccs->:sccs.co
  Check out a version from SCCS.  The parameters specify a version
  other than the top.
:sccs->:sccs.log
  Get the SCCS information for a revision control file.  The
  parameters specify information for a particular revision.
:,vw->:view.source.spec
  Convert a list of odin expressions into a view spec that includes potential
  RCS and SCCS sources.
:view.source.spec->:view.names
  Convert any file names in a list of odin expressions into one which
  references RCS and SCCS sources, if present.
:view.names->:vw.of
  Convert a list of odin expressions into a virtual directory spec where
  RCS and SCCS sources have been accounted for.
:vw.of->:vw.dir
  Convert a virtual directory spec where RCS and SCCS sources have been
  accounted for into a virtual directory.
