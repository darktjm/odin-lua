BUGS:
  +mp can probably be used to add arbitrary command-line options to nroff
  No support for troff/groff
roff:
  This package supports documentation written for UNIX roff.
:FILE->:so_inc_spec
  Create a view_spec of files included by roff source.  This is used for
  automatic dependency calculation.
:so_inc_spec->:so_inc
  Create a list of includes from a roff-generated view_spec.  This is
  used for automatic dependency calculation.
:so_inc->:all_so_inc
  Collect all includes recursively from roff-generated include lists.
  This is used for automatic dependency calculation.
:FILE->:eqn
  Format equations for roff.  The output retains its file type.
:eqn_in->:gnc.eqn
  Format equations for roff.  The output gets its type from the file
  name pattern after stripping off the ,eqn.
:tbl_in->:tbl
  Format tables for roff.
:roff->:nroff
  Run nroff to produce terminal formatted output from roff source.  The
  +mp parameter may be used to specify a single package to use when
  formatting (e.g. +mp='an' for man pages).
