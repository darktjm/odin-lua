BUGS:
  Can't specify format of library file name.  This is not too
  terrible, as it only drops the dependency, but not allowing name.lib
  disallows Windows native libraries.
code:
  This package supports object file management.
:sm->:sm.list
  Convert a system model file into a system model list
:sm.list->:code.list
  Flatten any system model file references in a system model list, recursively.
:code.list->:o_of
  Turn a list of code files into an Odinfile to map the code files
  which can produce object files from their full type name to their
  abbreviated name used elsewhere.
:o_of->:a
  Generate an archive of the specified object files, using ar.
  If \$ODIN_RANLIB is non-empty, run it on the archive as well.
->:libraries.view_desc
  Generate dependency information and library flags from +lib and
  +lib_sp arguments.  The +lib arguments can be command-line options
  (preceeded by dashes), absolute paths to library files (which are
  added to the dependencies), and library base names (for use with the
  -l option).  The latter are converted to dependencies based on the
   library path and added as options with -l.  The file associated
   with their dependency is assumed to be lib$<$name$>$.$<$ext$>$, where
   $<$ext$>$ is one of a, so, or sl, or one of those with two or more
   numeric extensions.
:libraries.view_desc->:libraries
  Converts view descriptor's valid entries into the list of libraries.
