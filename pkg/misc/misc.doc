BUGS:
  No way to specify diff parameters
  Nobody uses rsh/rcp any more; these should use ssh/scp instead
  Specifying both +f_dest and +d_dest should probably be an error
misc:
  This package contains miscellaneous support utilities.
:FILE->:list
  This reads a list from a file or directory.  If the input is a
  directory, the list is all file names in that directory.  If it is a
  file, the file is parsed as a sequence of odin-expressions.
:OBJECT->:redo
  This is an alias for !:redo
:err->:redo_errs
  This parses the errors produced for a target, and redoes any step
  which apparently produced errors.
:FILE->:boot_name
  This is checks if the target file exists.  If so, the result is the
  name of the file.  If not, the result is the name of the file
  specified by +default.  The +default parameter may be any odin
  expression.
:boot_name->:boot
  This converts the odin expression of the boot file name into a list of
  odin expressions.
:FILE->:diff
  This returns the difference between the input file and the file
  specified by +other.
:FILE->:rcp
  This copies the source file to the destination specified by +f_dest or
  +d_dest.  +f_dest overrides +d_dest.  +d_dest explicitly forces the
  destination to be a directory; +f_dest copies directly to the
  target, assuming it is a file.
