regsub:
  This package provides a simple egrep and sed replacement.
:FILE->:regsub
  Filters a file, showing (or hiding, if +hide_match is given) only
  lines that match the extended regular expression in +match (if given).
  On each line, a global substitution is made for each +subst parameter.
  This parameter consists of the search string, followed by a / that is
  not escaped, followed by the replacement string.  In the replacement
  string, a backslash escapes any character but the digits 0-9 and
  open curly braces.  An unescaped ampersand (\&) represents the entire
  matching text.  A backslash followed by a single digit, or a
  backslash followed by a curly-brace enclosed decimal number,
  represents that parenthesis-enclosed subexpression.  Subexpression
  zero is the entire matching text, and the rest numbered by the order
  of the opening parenthesis.  All +subst parameters are applied in the
  order they are given, so an earlier one may affect a later one.
  
  If the +subst_only parameter is given, any line which does not cause
  a substitution will be filtered out as well.  This is a shortcut for
  adding the +subst patterns as +match arguments.  Note that actual
  filtering using +match takes place before +subst substitution.
  
  The +prefix parameter text is prepended to each line, and the +suffix
  parameter is appended to each line.  They are shortcuts to +subst
  \^/$<$text$>$ and +subst \$/$<$text$>$, respectively, except that
  they do not count towards +subst_only, and only one of each may be
  given.
:regsub_in->:gnc.regsub
  Filters a file, showing (or hiding, if +hide_match is given) only
  lines that match the extended regular expression in +match (if given).
  The type of the file is based on source file name matching after
  stripping the trailing ,re.
  On each line, a global substitution is made for each +subst parameter.
  This parameter consists of the search string, followed by a / that is
  not escaped, followed by the replacement string.  In the replacement
