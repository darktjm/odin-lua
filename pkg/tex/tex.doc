tex:
  This package supports \TeX{} and \LaTeX{} documentation.
:tex->:one_tex_vtd
  Convert a single \TeX{} input file path into a virtual target translation
:tex.vtd->:rootName
  Return the file name and base name of the root document.  If there is
  only one document, its name is used.  Otherwise, the root document
  should be specified using +texroot.
:dir->:texsp
  Return a file containing directories, one per line, to search for \TeX{}
  inputs.  This includes the directory containing the virtual inputs,
  as well as any path specified by +texsearch.  If unspecified, the
  original source directory for the input file is used.
:texfiles->:texclose
  Given a list of \TeX{} files, list all files needed during a run.  This
  is for automatic dependency scanning.
:rootFileName->:texbasis
  Given a \TeX{} root file name, list all files needed during a run.  This
  is for automatic dependency scanning.
:texnames->:tex.view_desc
  Given a list of \TeX{} input files, produce a view descriptor.  This is
  for automatic dependency scanning.
:tex->:texnames
  Given a \TeX{} input file, return a list of files needed during a run.
:tex.view_desc->:texfiles
  Collapse view descriptor to actual present files.
:rootFileName->:fmtcmd
  Given a \TeX{} input file, determine which command to run for output.  If
  +usepdf is set, PDF is produced directly from input using
  pdf(la)tex.  If +tex is set, the input is plain \TeX{}.  If +latex is
  set, the input is \LaTeX{}.  Otherwise, selection is based on presence of
  the \LaTeX{} command \\documentstyle or \\documentclass.
:texsp->:dvi
  Run \TeX{} on inputs until auxiliary files settle.  The actual command
  to run is obtained by the \texttt{:fmtcmd} derivation.  The
  \texttt{:dvi} and \texttt{:texpdf} outputs are optional, and depend on
  the formatter type (\texttt{+usepf}).
:label->:one_tex_vtd
  Return a file listing the input \TeX{} file.
:texsp->:tex.bbl
  Given \TeX{} input, create a bibliography file if needed, using
  \texttt{bibtex}.
:indexntry->:tex.ind
  Given \TeX{} input, create indices using \texttt{makeindex}, if
  needed.
:tex.ind->:texauxin.vtd
  Return file listing all auxiliary inputs associated with a \TeX{} run.
:texsp->:texps
  After running \TeX{}, run \texttt{dvips} to convert the DVI output
  to PostScript.
:tex.vtd->:refpdf
  A back path to creating PDF using pdf(la)tex directly.
