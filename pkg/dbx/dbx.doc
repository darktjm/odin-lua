dbx:
  This package supports running a debugger on executables.
:exe->:dbx
  A script is created to run the debugger dbx/gdb (+gnu).  A core
  file may optionally be specified with +core.  It is intended to be
  used interactively with the ! suffix to execute the script.
BUGS:
  The script it generates is a shell script (i.e. can't really make it
  lua easily)
  The debugger's name is assumed, with no override other than dbx->gdb
