This directory contains the Odin software build system.  Users upgrading
from older Odin versions should consult the file "etc/CHANGES".

This version of Odin differes from the official one on Sourceforge.  See
etc/CHANGES for details.  Any questions/comments regarding those changes
should be sent to the author, darktjm@gmail.net, instead of the mailing
list below.  I have not participated in that mailing list as it
appears to have been dead for many years now.  You may have more luck
interacting with Eli (eli-project on Sourceforge), since they seem to
have taken over Odin maintenance.  I haven't interacted with them yet,
either, since this is still a work in progress (it works, but I want
to do more changes first).

For most machines and configurations, the following sequence of two
commands will build an executable version (both commands should be given
in the directory containing this README file):

        ./configure 
	./INSTALL install_dir

"install_dir", if it is present, must be an absolute path name to
an existing directory.	If the "install_dir" argument is omitted, it
defaults to "$HOME".

The INSTALL command will copy the Odin command script to the
file "install_dir/bin/odin", copy the Odin man page to the file
"install_dir/man/man1/odin.1", and install the default packages into
the directory "install_dir/lib/Odin".

None of the installed files or directories should be modified, except
for the file "install_dir/lib/Odin/ODINPATH".  This file can contain a
colon separated list of tool package libraries that will be appended to
every Odin user's $ODINPATH environment variable.

The following command deletes derived files produced during INSTALL of the
Odin system; it does not disturb files created by the configure step:

	./CLEAN
